Overview:
BreachBasket is a Bash-based automation tool designed to streamline e-commerce vulnerability assessments. Built on Kali Linux, it integrates seven open-source tools—including theHarvester, Nmap, SQLmap, and SSLscan—to perform thorough security evaluations across four key phases: reconnaissance, network scanning, SSL/TLS analysis, and e-commerce-specific testing.

Key Features:

Minimal input requirements (domain, host/IP, URL)
HTML dashboard visualizing vulnerabilities and remediation strategies
Tailored for payment system security and PCI DSS compliance
Operates within strict ethical, legal, and privacy boundaries

Impact:

By automating complex scanning tasks, BreachBasket reduces human error, lowers operational costs, and enables faster identification of high-risk vulnerabilities in retail platforms—empowering organizations to strengthen consumer trust and defend against fraud.
